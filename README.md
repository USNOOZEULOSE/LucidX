## Project Overview

### Name of Project
LucidX

### One-Liner
LucidX provides end-to-end donation tracking on the blockchain with verified intermediary wallets.

### Project Summary
LucidX is a revolutionary platform that enables charities to raise donations on-chain from the global community through proposals. These proposals provide donors with the transparency that is lacking in the industry, while the blockchain ensures a clear, immutable record of each donation's journey. Donors can track exactly where their money goes, boosting their confidence and trust in the donation process.

Videos on the Application can be found [Notion](https://screeching-erica-f50.notion.site/Videos-9db9ecd0770b4c519fd3459a80a01e11?pvs=4).

### Problem Addressed
**Target Industry: Charitable and non-profit sector**

1. **Transparency Deficit**: Donors often lack clarity on how their contributions are utilized, leading to mistrust.

2. **Accountability Gaps**: Traditional systems make it hard to pinpoint responsibility for funds from collection to deployment.

3. **Donor Fatigue**: Constant solicitations without visible impact discourage continued giving.

4. **Global Reach Limitations**: Traditional methods may not cater to a worldwide donor base effectively.

5. **Impact Awareness**: Donors remain uninformed about the tangible benefits and outcomes of their donations.

### Sponsored Challenges
- **NeonEVM**: Explain how the project uses NeonEVM technology/application.

### Future Features
1. **Native Token for Donations (Inspired by Gitcoin Grants)**
   - **Currency Transition**: Instead of relying on a single currency like USDC, donors will utilize LucidX tokens (LCX) for donations.
   - **Beneficial Staking**: Revenue generated from staking LCX will be directed to charities associated with LucidX.
2. **Automated Charity Funding**
   - **Inspiration**: Think of it as a Robo-Investor, but specifically tailored for donations.
   - **Efficiency & Personalization**: This feature aims to combat donor fatigue. Donors won't have to sift through countless proposals. Instead, an AI-driven system will present them with proposals that align with their preferences and values.
3. **Supplier Scoring System**
   - **Transparency Incentives**: Suppliers are encouraged to maintain transparency and provide regular updates to donors.
   - **Merit-Based Opportunities**: Suppliers with higher ratings will have increased opportunities to collaborate with non-profit organizations.
